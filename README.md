# Knight_trevails
A knight in chess is a very special piece. Since it moves in a "L", it can go to all squares in a 8x8 board. In here I'll use search algorithms to attempt to create an script that shows the minimum moves needed for a horse to go from a point A to a point B

<H1> After it was done <h1>

I've created a basic object named "Knight" and then created a graph made this object. In the end, to find the closest path, I've made a simple Breath First Search algorithm to find the desired end-point.
